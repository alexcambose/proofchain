# Info

Because the purpose of the traceability system is to be integrated as an extension into supply chain management systems, the library helps future developers to facilitate integration. Working directly with smart contracts requires, in addition to knowledge of the programming language, additional knowledge specific to the Ethereum platform and Web3.js, and the library aims to solve this problem by abstracting the way it interacts with contracts.

Proofchain library is a plug n play library that combines the simplicity of using typescript with the power of blockchain based smart contracts. It brings an interface of communicating with existing Proofchain smart contracts so that you don't have to go through the code.
