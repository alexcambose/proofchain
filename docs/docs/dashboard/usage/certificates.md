## Certificate management

The creation of a certificate is done by the certification authority through a form, specifying the name, a short description and the type of certificate. We can see both the creation form and the assignment forms to a company or material.
In the case of assignment to a company, the certification authority must specify the certificate code, company address and warranty, and in the case of assignment to a material, the material id will be specified instead of the company address. Also, each field in the form has validation, to ensure that the company address, material id or certificate code exists on the blockchain.

After creation, the certificates can be seen in a table similar to the one of the materials or more specifically, in a page that presents information about a certain certificate and the materials or companies to which it is assigned. the table on the left, or on the right if the certificate is assigned to a material, there is also a button that cancels the assignment of the certificate.
