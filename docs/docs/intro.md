# Intro

Proofchain leverages blockchain technology to facilitate efficient communication and data exchange between global supply chains, providing customers with proof of product provenance and ownership. It is a collection of smart contracts and Web3 based tools which are aiming to provide companies and customers with the required infrastructure to facilitate transparency across supply chains.

The following documentation is intended for getting a deeper understanding on how Proofchain works, both in terms of a technical point of view as well as from the point of view of its use in practice.

## At a glance

Proofchain is a collection of blockchain based tools which make up an open platform that anyone can interact with.
These include:

**Smart Contracts**: At the core of Proofchain are the smart contracts, written in Solidity, which live on the Ethereum blockchain. These make up an open platform that anyone can interact with.

**Proofchain Dashboard**: It offers a snapshot of the core features of the smart contracts based platform.

**Proofchain Web3 library**: A JS library which simplifies interacting with Proofchain contracts, facilitating communication between existing Supply Chain Management software and distributed ledged technology.

**Proofchain Client App**: A mobile-first web application that provides end users with the ability to view the complete provenance history of each product.
